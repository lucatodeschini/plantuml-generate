# PlantUML generate action

This action generates images based on the PlantUML text diagrams.

It generates the images "in place" alongside the `.puml` definition.

## Inputs

### `apply_style`

**Optional** The path of the style to apply to each diagram. Defaults to empty which means that no custom style is applied.

## Example usage

This workflow runs on very PR to the main branch and will generate the diagram images and commit them to the PR.
